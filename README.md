# Sleipnir
Feel yourself like a god with your own personal horse you can summon!

Sleipnir is a so called spigot-plugin that lets players summon their own personal horse via an ingame command.

Furthermore the summoned horse can be edited throught a GUI that shows up when opening the inventory while riding a summoned horse.

After dismounting the steed it will return to the Aether for awaiting future commands.
